# Coding-Question
Alice is assigned some homework by her teacher. The homework has a
question:
"You have an integer array with values ranging from 0 to N-1. Your task is to
replace the value of every number with its corresponding index value in the
list."
Since Alice is unable to solve this question, she is asking you for some help.
Can you help Alice finish her homework?
## Input format:
Each test case contains two lines of input: 
* The first line contains n, the array size. 
* The second line contains elements of the array separated by space.
## Output format:
* The output should consist of the resultant array with elements separated by

space.
## Sample Input:
* 4
* 3 2 0 1
## Sample Output:
2 3 1 0
## Explanation:
arr = [3 2 0 1]
indexes= [0 1 2 3]
Position array : [0 1 2 3]
Mapping indexes : [2 3 1 0]
The array after mapping is the
output.
Index of 0 is 2, so 2 comes in
place of 0. Index of 1 is 3 , so 3
comes . SImilarly , 2 is at index 1,
so 1 comes and finally 0 comes.
